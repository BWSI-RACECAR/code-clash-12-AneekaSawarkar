Code Clash #12 - One Up! (addone.py)


Author: Paul Thai

Difficulty Level: 6/10

Background: Do you know how to add? Good! I have just the question for you! 
Most people know how to add by one, but can you add by one in this problem???

Prompt: Given an array, add one to the ones column!

Constraints: You cannot map/join the list into a single number, add one, and then turn it back into a list. 
That's cheating (because I have done it before...) so you must modify the list itself. Be careful of place values! 

Test Cases:
a = [1, 2, 3]; output = [1, 2, 4]
a = [9]; output = [1,0]
a = [1, 4, 5, 9]; output = [1, 4, 6, 0]

class Solution:
    def addOne(self,ary):
        # type ary: list
        # return type: list

        # TODO: Write code below to return a list "ary" with the solution to the prompt
        length = len(ary)

        if length == 1 and ary[0] == 9:
            ary.append(0)
            ary[0] = 1
            return ary

        if ary[length-1] == 9:
            num = int(str(ary[length-2]) + str(9))
            print("HI")
            num += 1
            ary[length-2] = num // 10
            ary[length-1] = num % 10
        else:
            ary[length-1] += 1

        
        return ary
